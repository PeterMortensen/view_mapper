Generates view scaffolding code from an existing model or models.

See: http://patshaughnessy.net/view_mapper for more details.

Usage 1: Create standard new, show, edit, and list views for an existing model. This will inspect
the specified model and create attributes for each of the existing columns.

./script/generate view_for [MODEL NAME]

Example:  ./script/generate view_for person

Usage 2: Create new, show, edit, and list views for two associated models in a many to one relationship.
This will create a complex form allowing you to edit the parent and child models at the same time,
using Rails 2.3 nested attributes.

./script/generate nested_attributes_view_for [PARENT MODEL] containing:[CHILD MODEL]

Example: ./script/generate nested_attributes_view_for group containing:people
